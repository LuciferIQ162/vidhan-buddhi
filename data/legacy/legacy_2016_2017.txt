In July 2016, the Government of Odisha raised serious objections to the
construction of multiple upstream barrages on the Mahanadi river by
the State of Chhattisgarh.

The Chief Minister of Odisha described the upstream construction as
"blatant unilateral action" and stated that the state would fight to
protect the interests of downstream regions dependent on the river.

Reports from early 2017 highlighted growing hydrological distress.
According to reservoir monitoring data dated January 2017, the
Hirakud Dam recorded an inflow of approximately 3108 cusecs during
the non-monsoon period.

This reduced inflow was cited by the Odisha government as evidence
that upstream interventions were adversely affecting water availability
for irrigation and drinking purposes in downstream districts.

Public protests and political demonstrations were organised during
this period under the banner of "Save Mahanadi", reflecting the
intensity of the dispute.
